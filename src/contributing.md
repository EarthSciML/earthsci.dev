## Governance

The governance of EarthSciML is based on the [Plural Management](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4688040) model.
Members of the EarthSciML community can earn credits by contributing features, documentation, or fixes to the project, and then can use those credits to vote on the direction of the project.
