# EarthSci EDU

For those interested in learning more about GeoScience, we have a series of lessons (well, currently one lesson) using the [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.com/) online learning platform.
The lessons are available at [this link](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/143668).
(You might have to click on that link to join the online course before you can access the lessons.)
